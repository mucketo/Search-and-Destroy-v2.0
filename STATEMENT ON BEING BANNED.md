# Statement on being banned - 22 Dec 2018

On Saturday, 15 Dec 2018, I was banned for threatening to release a gquest-enabled version of S&D.  If you are told any other reason for my being banned, that person is saying things that are untrue (either through misinformation, or outright lying).  I had had a problem with Lasher moments before ftalking "hey asshole, maybe I should add GQUEST to S&D."  Yes, I capitalized gquest.  That is the "threat" Lasher referenced in his Mudinfo note.

Gquest-enabled S&D is nothing new, and various versions of it have been around for years.  Pwar's "Winklegold" is publicly available, and includes GQ support and a mob database, and plenty of people use it.  I have to wonder why this version has never been a problem, in terms of legality.  I was banned for "threatening" to release a GQ-enabled version, but Pwar has been going along just fine after actually releasing one, and with a mob DB besides.  Does that sound right to you?

If Lasher's claim that a gquest-enabled S&D is a bot, then he needs to address Winklegold, as well as the multitude of private versions which are written for closed clans and the like.  I predict that he will not do this.  These versions have existed for years so it would be interesting to see what his explanation is for suddendly deciding that a GQ version (what about a mob DB version?) is "illegal".  

To Lasher, frankly:  If gq S&D is "illegal" please start investigating current use cases and enforcing that rule, or else be shown to be totally full of baloney and generally not worth listening to.  I predict you will not do it.

So what happens with S&D now?

I keep developing it, that's what.  Somewhat less actively, I suppose, since testing will be harder.  I guess now I get to learn more about simulating MUD output on the client side, 

I'm writing this to make some things clear:

- Search and Destroy remains legal.  As downloaded from my Github, it is not considered a bot.  The only exception to this is if Lasher decides to enforce the no-qguest "rule" (that doesn't exist, and I believe won't). Users are still responsible for any modifications they make to the plugins (e.g. automation) and any consequences arising from that.  You do need to understand the botting rules if you want to use S&D.  If you plan on modifying your copy of S&D, please check with the immortals to confirm that the changes you're making are actually legal.

- S&D is safe to run, and always will be.  The only data it accesses is your mapper DB and the plugin state files.  It does not — and never has, and never will — contain malicious code of any kind, does not log your commands or keystrokes, and/or do anything else nefarious.  All of S&D's code is available here on Github.  Feel free to inspect it at any time, as doing so will verify all of the above.  There are plenty of coders on Aardwolf who are better than I am, and none of them have raised any trust issues at all.

- Lasher and company have forked my project and that's fine.  But you can rest assured that it will contain fewer features and do less.  It won't do GQ, for one thing, and certainly won't have a mob DB.  If you want the full package, this the place.  

If there are any questions feel free to email me at my gmail account (aardstar) and I will get back to you whenever I check the account.  I sincerely regret any inconvenience that my being banned has caused, but rest assured it is no bar to continuing active work on S&D.  I hope this clears some things up, in view of some of what has been said.
