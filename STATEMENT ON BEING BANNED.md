# Statement on being banned - 22 Dec 2018

On Saturday, 15 Dec 2018, I was banned for "threatening to release a gquest-enabled version of S&D."  If you are told any other reason for my being banned, that person is saying things that are untrue (either through misinformation, or outright lying).  I had had a problem with Lasher moments before ftalking "hey asshole, maybe I should add GQUEST to S&D."  Yes, I capitalized gquest.  That is the "threat" Lasher referenced in his Mudinfo note.  Seconds later, I was banned.  

"Maybe I should" isn't actually a threat.  Lasher had made an unconstructive reply to one of my ideas notes and I said it as an off-the-cuff remark in a moment of irritation.  I'm so sorry.  If Lasher hadn't made his pointless troll post, the whole situation never would have happened - way to manufacture a problem, architect.  If I get banned because I actually broke the rules, I can accept it as fair.  This ban is callously unfair and has no rational basis at all.  The only thing I did "wrong" was get irritated at Lasher's unencouraging reply and happened to say something he didn't like.

But as to Search and Destroy and gquest, gq-enabled S&D is nothing new, and various versions of it have been around for years.  Pwar's "Winklegold" is publicly available, and includes GQ support and a mob database, and people do use it.  I have to wonder why this version has never been a problem.  I was banned for "threatening" to release a GQ-enabled version, but Pwar's has been out for more than a year, and with a mob DB besides.  Many private versions (written for closed clans and the like, etc.) have also existed for years, probably for as long as S&D itself has existed.  So, for me to add one to this already large pool, how is that a problem *now*, of all times?  Why are the others not a problem?  It's logically inconsistent.

If Lasher's claim that a gquest-enabled S&D is a bot, then he needs to address Winklegold, as well as the multitude of private versions.  I predict that he will not do this.  All of these have existed for years so it would be interesting to see what the explanation is for suddendly deciding that a GQ version released by me (what about a mob DB version?) is "illegal".  On what grounds?  Why now?  

To Lasher, frankly:  If gq S&D is "illegal" please start investigating such use cases and enforcing that rule, or else be shown to be totally full of baloney and generally an unreliable information source.  I predict you will not do it.  Why bother?  It's never been a problem before.  Also, banning someone over a situation you made is callously unfair, even for you.  

I'm writing this to make some things clear:

- Search and Destroy remains legal.  As downloaded from my Github, it is not considered a bot.  The only exception to this is if Lasher decides to enforce the no-qguest "rule" (that doesn't exist, and I believe won't). Users are still responsible for any modifications they make to the plugins (e.g. automation) and any consequences arising from that.  You do need to understand the botting rules if you want to use S&D.  If you plan on modifying your copy of S&D, **please check with the immortals to confirm that the changes you're making are actually legal**.

- S&D is safe to run, always has been, and always will be.  The only data it accesses is your mapper DB and the plugin state files.  It does not — and never has, and never will — contain malicious code of any kind, does not log your commands or keystrokes, and/or do anything else nefarious.  All of S&D's code is available here on Github.  Feel free to inspect it at any time, as doing so will verify all of the above.  There are plenty of coders on Aardwolf who are better than I am, and none of them have raised any trust issues at all.  The insinuation that I'm putting malware or illegal code in it is insulting to me.

- S&D will not kill mobs for you, on room entry or any other time.  It will not complete anything for you without manual (i.e. you being there) control.  It will not auto-target the next mob on cp/gq kill.  This will never change, please don't ask.  

- S&D intentionally lacks commands to find a questor, quest request/complete, take a cp, or join a gquest. It doesn't define a "default" questor.  It's reasonable to expect that S&D users have the basic competence to locate the questor and interact with it manually.  If you haven't learned how to do that yet, I recommend completing the Academy goal and reviewing relevant helpfiles before attempting to use S&D.

- Lasher and company have ~~stolen~~ forked my project and that's fine.  But you can rest assured their "official" version will contain fewer features and do less than mine.  Theirs might get bug fixes if they can find someone willing to work on it.  If you want the full package, real McCoy with updates, this the place.  

- Gquest was the #1 user-requested feature, from new and old players alike.  Mob db/mastermind was #2.  There were dozens of requests for them.  Anyone with a private gq or db script has a leg up on everyone else who doesn't.  Providing a superior quality version helps to level that playing field.  

If there are any questions feel free to email me at my google mail account (aardstar) and I will get back to you whenever I check the account.  Thanks for any remaining support.

Btw, Lasher apparently considers the following to be constructive feedback as well:

15 Dec 14:44:20 - Lasher tells you 'the only direct talk I have is that you are a cancer on this game it would be better without. For a decade I tried to convince myself that could change. I'm done.'

Nice.  Thanks for the encouraging message.  Way to set a positive example by throwing stones in your glass house.
